# hyperparameter-tuning
This project is an ML project and about Hyperparameter Tuning of adjusting values of parameters to optimize the performance of the ML model!
In this project, I have first used RandomSearchCV for larger hyperparameter space and then used GridSearchCV for narrow, more focused, refined hyperparameter space!
